# drum-machine-app-FCC
React-Drum-Machine-FCC

I made this app locally first and then adapted it to a codepen so that it could be filtered through FCC's tests. The version I'm uploading here is the local version which IMO has better functionality than the CodePen machine I made which doesn't let the user adjust the volume. 

Notes: 

1.) Again, to run these files locally you must have nodejs, react, or some other local server to host the files. 
2.) Most fun part of the project was playing around with the drum-machine for countless hours making music. 
3.) Could easily be improved upon to have different kits and more user customization options.
